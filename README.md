# FULLSTACK_BLOG_FORUM_WEBSITE
A full stack block website with admin panel. This is my first full stack project, a blog website in PHP and MYSQL


steps to clone or use this blog website
- download all the folders and files in this repository, in total you should have 14 items in all
- unzip the js.zip file
- put all the downloaded files with the folders in a name folder of your choice, don't forget to include the unziped js folder
- put your names folder in your local disk thus "This PC> xamp> htdoc> yournamedfolder"
- open your entire named folder in your code editor
- Install Xamp, thus the local host
- Run your xamp to set up the local machine
- open your browser and set up a database for the blog website with the database file provided



Enjoy!
